                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Leena and I have been a passionate makeup artist for just over 20 years. From a very
                  young age I was surrounded by creativity as my dad and uncle were wedding photographers and
                  videographers<br /><br />

                  Me and my sisters would sit for hours at the table sorting photos, listening to classic tunes
                  and watch them as they selected photos ready to be stuck into album’s. I used to look at the
                  brides in the photos admiring the beautiful outfits and thinking why they looked grey in all
                  the makeup (foundation tones weren’t the best then!).<br /><br />
                  Growing up I knew I wanted to be in the creative field and was very lucky that my parents
                  supported my choices and let me follow my artistic dreams from School, College and Uni.

                <p>When I was 19, my cousin asked me to do her make up for her wedding day. I was no trained
                  make-up artist, and it was a little scary to have such a big responsibility for a special day.
                  After this day I was hooked! I loved what I had created and the make- up artist bean was
                  sown.<br /><br />
                  After returning home from Uni, I completed a NVQ 2 Make up and beauty course and have never
                  looked back. I love creating red carpet flawless looks for all my clients and being part of
                  their special day.
